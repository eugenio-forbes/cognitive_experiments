In this experiment we are trying to see differences
in brain activity related to the length of time between
the formation of a memory and when it was recollected.
 
In this experiment, you will first study two lists of
words. In between the two study sections there will
be a break.
 
In each study section, words will be sequentially displayed
on the screen for a few seconds. A distinc landscape
will be displayed along with each word. The goal is for
you to remember what particular landscape a word was
presented with. In order to help you with this,
you should imagine the item of each word within that
landscape.
 
There will be another break before the test section begins.
 
In the test section, you will similarly be shown a list of
words paired with a landscape. In this section you will be
asked whether the landscape shown with the word is the
same as when you first studied the word, whether it is 
different, or whether the word shown is a new word 
(a word you did not see in the study sections).
