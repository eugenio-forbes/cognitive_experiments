INSTRUCTIONS
 
You will be shown a list of words. Each word will
be shown with one of three different landscapes.
 
The goal is for you to remember which landscape
each of the words in the list belongs to.
 
Try to visualize that word in the landscape or
make a story of that word inside the landscape.
 
This will make it easier for you to remember that
the word belongs to that landscape.
 
In addition to this, in this study section we will
ask you to respond one question about the word:
"Is the word shown a living thing that moves or is
it an object that remains still?"
 
The controller has buttons "A" for animate,
 
and "I" for inanimate.
 
Press "A" if the word shown is alive and moves.
 
Press "I" if the word shown is an object that remains still.
 
Examples of living things: People, animals.
 
Examples of still objects: Clothing, food, furniture, vehicles.
 
Example:
 
KANGAROO   -> You would press "A" because this is a living animal.
 
STRAWBERRY -> You would press "I" because this is food and does not move.
 
RACECAR    -> You would press "I" because this is a vehicle and does not move on its own.
 
Each word will be shown in the screen for a few seconds. 
 
You may only press your answer while the word is being displayed.
 
Then you will have a few seconds to rest before the next word appears.
 
You can only log 1 response per word, and there is no way to change your response.
 
If you have any questions, please ask the researcher now.
