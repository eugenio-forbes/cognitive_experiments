INSTRUCTIONS
 
You will be shown a list of words.
 
Some of the words will be words that you saw in the study sections.
 
Some of the words will be "new" words (you have not seen them in the study sections).
 
There is one thing to keep in mind for this test section.
 
This time, for some of the words that you did see in the previous study sections, the image of the landscape shown with the word will be different.
 
For some of the words the image of the landscape will remain the same as it was in the study section.
 
In this test section we will ask you to respond one question about the word:
 
"Is the landscape shown with the word the same as when you first studied it, is the landscape different, or is the word a "new" word (one you didn see in study sections).
 
Press "N" if the word shown is a "N"ew word.
 
Press "S" if the landscape shown with the word is the "S"ame as it was when you first studied it.
 
Press "R" if the landscape shown with the word has been "R"earranged i.e. it is different from when you first studied it.
 
You may only press the button with your answer while the word is being displayed.
 
Then you will have a few seconds to rest before the next word pair appears.
 
You can only log 1 response per word pair, and there is no way to change you response.
 
Make your best attempt to not make any guesses.
 
This is a challenging task; do not be discouraged.
All we ask is for you to try your best.
