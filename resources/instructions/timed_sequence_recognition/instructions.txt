Please scroll down through the instructions:

1) There are several rounds. In each round, 
you will be shown four different sequences. 

2) Structure of each sequence:
Emoji -> Celebrity Face #1 -> Blank -> Celebrity Face #2

3) From the four sequences, a pair of them shares the same two celebrity images,
the other pair shares the images of two different celebrities.
The sequence of each pair is different from the other in the duration of the
blank image that separates the display of the two celebrities.
Each sequence is identified by a different emoji.

4) You will have to remember which emoji identifies each sequence, paying
attention to the time interval of the blank image that separates the two
celebrities.

5) Please do not count the passing of time, tap, or use any other aid for this matter.

6) After the four sequences are presented, there will be a break of several seconds.

7) After the break, one of the four sequences will be shown again without its emoji.

8) You will be asked to choose the emoji that identifies that sequence.
